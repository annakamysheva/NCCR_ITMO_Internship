Contains code and results for: 
 1) Prediction outcomes of arterial hypertension cases in patients using they medical records
 2) Frequency analysis of chronical diseases in St.Petersburg, Russia.  

## Prediction of Arterial hypertension cases 

Initial internship assigment aimed to predict outcomes of arterial hypertension cases in monitored patients using ML algorithms and various medical data, including patient characteristics, information about the course of the disease and the type of treatment. 

## Frequency analysis of chronical diseases in St.Petersburg, Russia.

The aims of the project was:  
+ to create interactive map of Saint Petersburb's districts, which shows frequency of occurance of above thirty chronical diseases in these districts
+ to find enviromental and socio-economic factors which affects the distribution of chronical diseases in this city 

Repository contains: 
1) Example of interactive map (html-file)
